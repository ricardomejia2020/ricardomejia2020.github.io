The activity that I did this week was to study a piece of software that I am not familarized with. As mentioned in previous blogs, I am involved in the sneaker community and I have several autocheckout softwares. However normally these softwares have a User Interfaces and the one I had to use this week is a CLI, which is command line based. In order to use this software efficiently , I had to study it for approxamately 3 hours with no guide and had to figure out the commands and memorized them. It was a challenge.
