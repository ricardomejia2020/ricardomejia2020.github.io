This week, the task I preformed was driving up to Stockton without no breaks. It was my first time ever driving up to NorCal so I had no clue on what to expect. It was a long dive, the good thing about it was that it was all straight road and nothing dangerous happened. I was a little scared because when driving to Vegas, there is a part of the road that gets a little nasty and pulls you in to the middle. I enjoyed the little road trip I took and would love to start traveling more by road.
