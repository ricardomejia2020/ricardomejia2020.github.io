This week an important task that I did was to help subscribers from a company who pay to be able to use a software that is in charge of mass entering emails to online raffles for shoes. I am a staff member of said company and I troubleshoot members to questions in regards the software. From simple things like knowing in which tab do the proxies go to helping members install the software in their virtual server. It is a concept that is not well known to many people since this is solely for the sneaker community.
