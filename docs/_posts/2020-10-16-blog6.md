This week I dedicated my time finishing a project for Web Engineering.
It was a simplle project involving CSS and HTML.
We were suppose to do a resume website from scratch with a navigation bar that allows the user to jump into the desired page section within the home page. It was a pretty fun project to do and I learned alot doing it since I am not an expert to HTML
