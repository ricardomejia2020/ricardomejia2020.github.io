This week, I worked on some HTML websites for Comp 484.
There were several labs that involved understanding HTML tags and attributes, I have some knowledge about HTML so the labs
resulted to be fairly simple. I am currently struggling to finish lab1 from CIT 480. I missed the first classes due to schedule conflicts at work.
I cannot get everything properly installed and havent been able to find the answers.
