This week , I did not do anything System Administrative related. However I built a computer for work and gmaing related reasons. It is an amd ryzen 9 and it was my first build ever. This task took me about half a day trying to figure out where do the components go. The challenging part for me was figuring out issues I had along the way since this was my first time actually building a computer from scratch.
When I was installing the cpu fan, I forgot to check which side I wanted the fan to face and had already applied the thermal paste onto the cpu.
